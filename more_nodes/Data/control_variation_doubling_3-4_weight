Usual network with 8 nodes
control form: Pmax*tanh(delta*theta)
variation of Pmax from 1.000000 to 0.000000 with step 0.010000
and modifying delta as 0.1/Pmax to keep slope stable to 0.1 (in approx) 
Computation of stability reached/unreached in every variation of Pmax with comparison after 50000 and 51000 steps
Computation is stopped when stability is not reached anymore
Error is computed as sum_i ( |(theta_50000[i] - theta_51000[i]| ) 
Stability is not reached if error >=   1.00000000e-06
