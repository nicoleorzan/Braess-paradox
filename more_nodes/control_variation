control form: Pmax*tanh(delta*theta)
Pmax = 0.100000, variation of delta from 1.000000 to 0.500000 with step 0.010000
Computation of stability reached/unreached in every variation of delta with comparison after 25000 and 25100 steps
Computation is stopped when stability is not reached anymore
Error is computed as sum_i ( |(theta_old[i] - theta_new[i]| ) 
Stability is not reached if error >=   1.00000000e-09
